Welcome
----------

This repo is to help with the setup of an amenable emacs environment.
This effort was borne from the fact that I often find that I am on a
foriegn or new machine that I have to quickly setup and do work on.
Having a cogent and customized environment is key to working
effectively. So, this is an effort to create such an environment in a
way that is flexible for others to perhaps get use from.  Leveraging
GIT seemed like the right thing to do.

In this repo you will find the scripts, configuration and packages
necessary to set up your emacs environment.  I code for a living,
which I assume is the same for you, so the environment is of a
distinctly developer ilk. I have included an install "setup" script to
do the installation and have functions to help keep things up-to-date.
My friends thus far enjoy it and I hope you will too.

Some goodies: In the "custom" directory there are a couple of elisp
programs I wrote to do tiny things like cursor-in-place scrolling and
such.

----------
INSTALLATION:
----------

%> bash <(curl -s http://moya.6thcolumn.org/resources/emacs/ezsetup)

OR

%> cd ~/
%> git clone git://github.com/gavinmbell/emacs_resources.git ~/.emacs_resources
%> cd .emacs_resources
%> ./setup
%> (re)start emacs

Then...

(smile)

Both ezsetup and setup have options that are described via --help | -h

Once you have this installed, you may put an additional customizations in file:

 ~/.emacs.d/.emacs_local

This file, if exists, is loaded at the end of the load sequence.

----------
UPDATING:
----------

To make it easy to stay updated with the latest changes, there is a function to call.
Regardless of where you are located in the file system you can always call:

%> check_for_emacs_resources_update

This will update this project from the git repository and branch that the project is locally at.

I should have done this a long time ago... enjoy! :-)
